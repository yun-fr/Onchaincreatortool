=========================================================

This is a tampermonkey script that work on Chrome/Brave/Firefox (for chrome/brave you need to activate developper mode on : chrome://extensions/ or brave://extensions/ )
The script is only active on https://app.layer3.xyz/ website
The main goal is to add a ref on Layer3 links automatically to which I added a tool helping to make multichain transactions for streaks.

*If you got "Unrecognized chain ID error" it means you didn't have the blockchain on your wallet, you have to add it manualy first
*Please note that transaction are basically sending 0 to smartcontract such as relay/bunguee/lifi/layerswap..
  It's a good alternative to onchaingm that cost ~0,05$ per transaction in addition of gas.
